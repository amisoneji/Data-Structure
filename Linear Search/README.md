# Linear Search

- *Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm*
- so whatever tha size of list it will take that much of comparisons for searching any element
- so take a data like array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] in which n(no of element)=8
- if we want to find a target from a array it will take array length of comparison
- The Best case is when we find a target that is present at the first index of array so it will compare the once..
-  **Best case for time complexity become O(1) (1 comparison)**
-  **the worst case we didn't find target in the array so it will take the n no of comparison,So worst case become O(n)**

- When to use linear search algorithm:
1. **When the list contains lesser elements**
2. **When searching for a single element in an unordered array**
