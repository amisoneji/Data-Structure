***Recursion***
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- A function calling another function or function calling it self.
- That way we can say that,that one particular logic will repeated for other function calling.
- When one function calling another function, all the function from start to that function will stay in stack memory till the function execution will complete.
- When a function Finishing execution it is removed from stack & the flow of program is restored where that function is called.

**Base condtiom**

  It is the condition where our recursion stop making new call.

- If there will no base condition function call will keep happning and stack will be filled again and again and with every call it will take stack memory and memory will exceed the limit and the error occure called **stack over flow**.
